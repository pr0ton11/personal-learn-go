# 06-Map

## Goal of this session

1. Learn about maps in Go
2. Extend the examples in meaningful ways

## Results

* Maps work similarly to other languages hashmaps or lists
* In this example code I did some calculations with percentages
* It is more difficult to iterate maps (numeric keys can not be used). Instead the range has to be used to loop.
