# 01-HelloWorld

## Preparations

### Installing GO on Linux

1. Downloading Go from [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
2. Extracting Go to /usr/local/go

### Preparing Go Paths on Linux

1. Adding /usr/local/go/bin to PATH in .bashrc
2. Setting `GOPATH={Path for Libraries}:{Path for Source Code}(:..)` in Bashrc (More items in Array Delim : Allows Go to search more paths)
3. Creating Common folders src, pkg and bin in $GOPATH

## Goal of this Session

Make Go print Hello World, used as example that everything is running correctly

## Result

I expected no problems writing the most simple program in Go. It worked flawlessly in my first try
