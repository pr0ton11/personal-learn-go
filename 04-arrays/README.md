## Goal of this session

Understanding arrays and slices

## Results

* Arrays must have values of the same type
* Arrays have a fixed size
* When you need dynamic sizes, you need to use slices
* Assignments copy the array in memory
* Arrays can be referenced with & as pointer

* Slices are arrays without fixed size
* `len` and `cap` can be used to check sizes
* `append` allows to add new elements
* `make` allows to assign new slices, with extended capacity
