# 03-Constants

## Goal of this session

Understanding constants, how they can be used and additional compiler rules

## Results

* Constants can not change, but can be overwritten in other blocks
* Values of constants have to be clear at compilation time 
* They should be named like other variables, because they will be exported as well
* Typed constants can not change type, except when overwritten in other blocks, untyped could interact with similar types
* Const blocks work like Enums in other languages
* IOTA can control the id of enum members
* IOTA can be set dynamic with Bitshift operations

* It was a lot of fun creating and playing around with constants and enums
