# 02-Variables

## Goal of this session

Basic Knowledge about assigning variables, playing with conversions and typing

## Result

* I am very impressed about the typing of Go, especially about the strong rules that are enforced
* A lot of rules allow the optimization of code without thinking about it much
* The scopes of variables only allows Public, Package and Block based definitions
* Conversions are a bit more difficult when coming from other languages (C#, Python)
* Go does not include datatypes and conversions of higher abstractions in Base packages
